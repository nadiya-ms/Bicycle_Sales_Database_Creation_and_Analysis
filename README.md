# Bicycle Sales Databases Creation and Analysis
Bicycle Sales Database, SQL queries, Python code, EDA
This repository contains examples of creating two databases: `bikes_data_base` and `bicycle_sales_database`.

This repository provides examples of creating and structuring two databases:
- `bikes_data_base`: The bikes.bike_sales database is built from data imported from `bike_sales.csv`.
- `bicycle_sales_database`: Data is inserted into the database.

The examples demonstrate:

- Usage of various data types.
- Defining relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys.
- Basic data analysis techniques.

Data analysis is also provided.
